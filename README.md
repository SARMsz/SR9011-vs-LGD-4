<h1>SR9011 vs LGD-4: My Experience With Both SARMs</h1>

<p>If you're debating between <strong>SR9011</strong> and <strong>LGD-4</strong>, it really comes down to your goal — cutting fat or building muscle. I’ve run full cycles of both, and they’re completely different animals. In this article, I’ll break down what each one did for me, what to expect, and who should use which.</p>

<p>Both were tested from Chemyo — reliable source, third-party tested. These are the exact products I used:</p>

<h2>What Are They?</h2>

<h3>SR9011</h3>
<p>SR9011 isn’t technically a SARM — it’s a Rev-ErbA agonist. That means it boosts metabolic activity, increases fat oxidation, and improves endurance. Think of it like cardio in a bottle. But it won’t build much muscle.</p>

<h3>LGD-4</h3>
<p>LGD-4 is a second-generation version of LGD-4033 (Ligandrol). It’s designed for muscle growth, strength, and recovery — with fewer side effects than the original. If you’re trying to bulk up, this is the one you’re looking at.</p>

<h2>How I Tested SR9011 and LGD-4</h2>

<p>I ran both in separate 6-week solo cycles. Kept my diet clean — high protein, moderate carbs, low sugar. No alcohol. Gym 5x a week. No other compounds used during testing.</p>

<h2>My SR9011 Results</h2>

<p>Dose: 30mg/day split into 3 doses (10mg every 6 hours)</p>

<p>SR9011 felt subtle at first, but within the first week, I noticed two major things: better sleep and more stamina. Cardio sessions felt way easier — I could push longer without feeling gassed. By week 2, I was sweating more during workouts and the scale started shifting down.</p>

<p>I lost 5.5 lbs over 6 weeks, mostly fat. Waist was tighter, abs were sharper. I wasn’t gaining any muscle, but I was definitely preserving it while losing fat — I looked more athletic overall.</p>

<p>No suppression, no crash, no need for PCT. Just smooth sailing.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, fat loss, endurance</p>

  <li>Won’t build muscle</li>
</ul>

<h2>My LGD-4 Results</h2>

<p>Dose: 10mg/day, taken once in the morning</p>

<p>LGD-4 kicked in quick. By the end of week 1, I felt fuller, stronger, and hungrier. Week 3 was the sweet spot. Strength was climbing steadily, pumps were crazy, and I was recovering faster than normal. I gained 6-7 lbs across 6 weeks — all lean, no bloat. Clothes fit tighter around the shoulders and arms, not the gut.</p>

<p>Only downside was some suppression by the end of the cycle. My energy dipped a bit and libido wasn’t as high, but it wasn’t terrible. I ran a basic PCT and bounced back in 3 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Bulking, strength, recomposition</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solid lean muscle gains</li>
  <li>Strength and performance boost</li>
  <li>Dry, clean mass</li>
  <li>Great recovery between workouts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some suppression (requires PCT)</li>
  <li>Not useful for cutting fat</li>
</ul>

<h2>SR9011 vs LGD-4: Which Should You Use?</h2>

<p>They’re not interchangeable. Here’s the simple breakdown:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use SR9011</strong> if your goal is to cut fat, boost endurance, or improve conditioning — especially during a shred or prep phase. It’s great for cardio-based athletes.</li>
  <li><strong>Use LGD-4</strong> if your goal is to gain lean mass, build strength, and improve recovery. It’s a better choice for bulk or recomp.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want the best of both, you could stack them — SR9011 to burn fat, LGD-4 to hold onto (or build) muscle. Just keep in mind LGD-4 will need a short PCT.</p>
